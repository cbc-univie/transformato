Welcome to transformato's documentation!
=========================================================

:code:`transformato` is a lightweight implementation of the Boresch-Braunsfeld Serial-Atom-Insertion Common-Core (SAI-CC) approach [#f1]_ to relative binding/solvation free energy calculations [#f2]_. 
It does so by connecting the physical endstates of two molecules via two separate alchemical paths. The common core is defined as the maximum topology mapping between the two molecular graphs.
